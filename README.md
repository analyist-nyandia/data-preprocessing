Walmart Sales Analysis
This project analyzes the Walmart sales dataset to identify trends, patterns, and potential insights into weekly sales.

Project Goals
The main objectives of this project are:

Identify missing data and eliminate duplicate entries: Ensure data quality by handling missing values and removing duplicates.
Transform the Date column into a Pandas datetime object: Convert the 'Date' column to a datetime format for time-series analysis.
Add a new column called Revenue: Calculate a hypothetical 'Revenue' column based on 'Weekly_Sales' and 'Fuel_Price'.
Identify and handle Garbage values: Further check for any inconsistencies or invalid entries in the data.
Standardize the categorical column holiday_flag: Map numerical values in 'Holiday_Flag' to descriptive labels ("No Holiday", "Holiday").
Identify any outliers: Detect and highlight potential outliers in the dataset that might affect analysis.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Walmart Sales dataset. It contains the following columns:

Store: Store number
Date: The week of sales
Weekly_Sales: Sales for the given week
Holiday_Flag: Whether the week is a holiday week (1) or not (0)
Temperature: Temperature in the region
Fuel_Price: Cost of fuel in the region
CPI: Consumer Price Index
Unemployment: Unemployment rate
Analysis Steps
The analysis in this notebook follows these steps:

Loading the dataset using pandas.
Checking for and handling missing values and duplicates.
Converting the 'Date' column to datetime objects.
Creating a new 'Revenue' column.
Standardizing the 'Holiday_Flag' column.
Analyzing the skewness and kurtosis of numerical columns to identify potential outliers.
How to Use
To run this notebook and replicate the analysis:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python and pandas installed.
Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment (like Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, or JupyterLab).
Run the cells sequentially to perform the data loading, cleaning, transformation, and analysis steps.
Dependencies
pandas
Future Work
Visualize the data to better understand trends and relationships between variables.
Perform more in-depth outlier detection and handling.
Explore the impact of holidays on weekly sales.
Build a predictive model for weekly sales.
